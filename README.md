# DolphEngine
A framework-agnostic .NET Core game engine

I'm working on a 2D game engine in .NET Core that separates the Monogame and not-Monogame concerns in hopes that one day the Monogame parts can be replaced by native .NET stuff. Since there's currently nothing available in terms of drawing tools in .NET Core, it might be a long time before that comes to fruition.

This is just a hobby project that I work on occasionally to try and learn game development. I didn't enjoy playing around in Unity, but I really enjoy writing C#, so I'm practicing here instead. Feel free to watch or star, maybe this will go somewhere someday!
